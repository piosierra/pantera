# Transposable Elements library generation from a pangenome

A pangenome is a collection of genomes or haplotypes that can be aligned and stored as a variation graph in gfa format. 
This tool receives as input a list of gfa files of non overlapping variation graphs and produces a library of transposable elements found to be polymorphic on those pangenomes.

DONE:
- Extraction of unique segments
- Consensus sequences for "zones"

TO DO:
- Cluster final sets
- Structure filter
- Final classifier (Optional)
- Final report

# v5 
# Improvements on selection of segments
# Correct path added to name
# Zones dynamically created
# More info included in names. It can be used in the postprocessing.
