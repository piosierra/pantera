# Transposable Elements library generation from a pangenome

A pangenome is a collection of genomes or haplotypes that can be aligned 
and stored as a variation graph in gfa format. 
This tool receives as input a list of gfa files and produces a library of 
transposable elements found to be polymorphic on those pangenomes.

DONE:
- Extraction of unique segments
- Consensus sequences for "zones"

TO DO:
- Cluster sequences in Wicker "families".
- Structure filter
- Final classifier
- Final report
